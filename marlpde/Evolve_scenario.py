def integrate_equations(solver_parms, tracker_parms, pde_parms):
    '''Perform the integration and display and store the results.

    This function retrieves the parameters of the Scenario to be simulated and 
    the solution parameters for the integration. It then integrates the five
    partial differential equations from L'Heureux, stores and returns the 
    solution, to be used for plotting. Its input comes from the parameters
    module, which has dataclasses governing the solver, storage and model specs,
    through the solver_parms, tracker_parms and pde_parms dicts, respectively.

    A progress bar shows how long the (remaining) integration will take.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    solver_parms: dict 
        Parameters about solver settings.
    tracker_parms: dict 
        Parameters about the progress bar and time interval for storage
    pde_parms: dict
        Model parameters, which govern e.g. the physical processes, but
        also the discretization, such as the number of grid cells.

    Returns:
    --------
    field_solutions: ndarray
        This is the "y" attribute of "sol" i.e. the solution derived by
        solve_ivp. See the scipy.integrate.solve_ivp documentation for
        some background. A reshape has been applied to arrive at one row per
        field. The solutions as a function of time have been removed such that
        only the solution for the last time is returned.

    covered_time: float
        This is the time interval of integration in years, from the start time
        (probably 0) until the requested final time. When the integration halted
        unexpectedly, the covered_time corresponds to the time covered until the
        integration halted.

    depths: pde.CartesianGrid
        These are the centers of the grid cells that together constitute the 
        grid.
    
    Xstar: float
        Scaling factor between physical depths and dimensionless depths as used
        in the differential equations.

    Store_folder: str
        Could be a relative path, i.e.  a path relative to the root of this 
        repository, to a folder where solutions of the integration should be 
        stored. Could also be an absolute path, though.
